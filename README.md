# 2D Rectangle Class in C++

## Overview

This C++ program implements a 2D Rectangle Class with floating-point coordinates. It includes methods for constructing an axis-aligned Rectangle with initial size and coordinates, a Copy constructor, and an Assignment operator. Additionally, it provides algorithms to check whether a 2D point is contained in an axis-aligned Rectangle and whether two axis-aligned Rectangles intersect. The README also includes simple test code to create instances of the class and test the implementation.

## Rectangle Class

The Rectangle class represents an axis-aligned rectangle in a 2D space. It provides the following functionalities:

- **Constructor**: Constructs a rectangle with given initial size and coordinates.
- **Copy Constructor**: Creates a copy of a given rectangle.
- **Assignment Operator**: Assigns one rectangle to another.
- **Containment Check**: Checks if a 2D point is contained within the rectangle.
- **Intersection Check**: Determines whether two rectangles intersect.

## Usage

To use the Rectangle class and its functionalities:

1. Include the `Rectangle.h` header file in your C++ program.
2. Create instances of the Rectangle class using the constructor or copy constructor.
3. Use the containment and intersection check methods to perform desired operations.
